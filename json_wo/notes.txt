json
    say you just want to create the following json:
    {
        "idTag": "TIMEOUT_TEST"
    }
    this would do that for you:
        json payload = json::object({{"idTag","TIMEOUT_TEST"}});

    to populate a payload, we just make the struct, populate it and
    dump it into the sending mechanism.

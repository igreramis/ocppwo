Great—using your context file as the ground truth for what “Milestone 3” is about (Session Reconnect) and how your stack is shaped (WsClient + Session + ClientUnderTest, smoke tests done), here’s a focused review of how EVerest/libocpp approaches connection robustness, followed by a hands-on exercise that will move your codebase cleanly into Milestone 3. 

# What libocpp hints at for reconnect behavior (actionable takeaways)

* **Reconnect & offline buffering exist in the wild.** Recent issues show libocpp deals with “offline → cache → online → resend” flows; correlation can get tricky if state is inconsistent across the transition. That’s a strong signal to keep a single source of truth for “online/offline” and to gate sending while reconnecting. ([GitHub][1])
* **Ping/Pong matters for liveness.** There’s an open request to support **server-initiated WebSocket pings** so clients can be dropped quickly when dead (common behind load balancers). Even if you rely on reads to fail, having an explicit liveness signal improves your disconnect detection. Build your state machine to allow such signals later. ([GitHub][2])
* **Config toggles around the socket exist.** EVerest modules expose knobs like `EnableExternalWebsocketControl` (allow forcing disconnect/connect for testing) and `MessageQueueResumeDelay` (delay before resuming message queue after reconnect). You don’t need these exact names, but you *do* want the same ideas: an injectable reconnect policy and a short grace delay after re-handshake to avoid thundering herds. ([everest.github.io][3])
* **Docs emphasize full integration and robust session loop.** Their 1.6 getting-started and how-to pages show the library is used inside a larger orchestration loop. Your Milestone 3 should establish that loop: detect close → schedule reconnect with backoff → re-authenticate (Boot) → resume heartbeats. ([GitHub][4])

# Milestone 3 exercise — “Reconnect loop with clean state & no double-send”

**Goal:** implement a reconnect state machine that (a) notices transport closure, (b) backs off and reconnects without dropping control of the send path, (c) reboots the OCPP session cleanly, and (d) guarantees **no message duplicates** across the transition. (This dovetails with your Milestone 4–5 plans later.) 

## Part A — Add a small, explicit state machine

Add to `Session` (or a tiny `ReconnectManager` it owns) these states:

* `Disconnected` → `Connecting` → `Connected` → `Closing` (optional)
* Sub-flags: `online_` (bool), `backoff_attempt_` (int), `in_rehandshake_` (bool)

**Events** your transport already produces (via callbacks) should drive transitions:

* `on_connected()` → `Connected`
* `on_close()` / read error → `Disconnected`
* manual `stop()` → `Closing`

**Policy knobs** (mirroring libocpp ideas):
`initial_backoff_ms` (e.g., 500), `max_backoff_ms` (e.g., 30_000), `jitter_pct` (e.g., ±20%), `resume_delay_ms` (e.g., 250) similar to `MessageQueueResumeDelay`. ([everest.github.io][3])

**Rules**

1. While not `Connected`, **do not** allow application sends (return `LocalError{ConnectionClosed}` immediately). This avoids the “double send after reconnect” trap seen in the wild. ([GitHub][1])
2. When `on_close()` fires:

   * Mark `online_ = false`.
   * Cancel all **in-flight timers** and resolve their promises with `ConnectionClosed`.
   * Schedule `reconnect_timer_` with backoff (exp + jitter).
3. On reconnect success:

   * Run your **BootNotification** again; only on `Accepted` flip `online_ = true`.
   * Wait `resume_delay_ms` before emitting heartbeats (emulates libocpp’s queue resume delay). ([everest.github.io][3])
   * send `BootNotification`
   * on `Accepted`, start heartbeats
   * start normal read loop

## Part B — Implement exponential backoff with jitter

* Backoff `t = min(max_backoff, initial_backoff * 2^attempt)`.
* Apply jitter: `t = t * uniform(0.8, 1.2)`.

Reset `backoff_attempt_ = 0` once fully `Connected` and Boot is `Accepted`.

## Part C — Socket lifecycle glue in `WsClient`

* Expose `connect(url)` and `close()` futures that resolve when handshake/close completes.
* Ensure **single connect in flight**; if `connect()` is called while already connecting, return an error or coalesce.
* Keep the **strand** serialization you already have for writes; reconnection must not interleave with a lingering write.

## Part D — Session bring-up on reconnect

* On `Connected`:

  1. send `BootNotification`
  2. on `Accepted`, start heartbeats
  3. start normal read loop

(You’ve done this for the first connection in Milestone 1; now just reuse it after reconnection.) 

## Part E — Tests (GoogleTest integration)

Write **four** new tests in your existing loopback setup:

1. **Reconnect_Basic**
   Server accepts connection → client boots → server forcibly **closes** the WebSocket → client should:

   * schedule reconnect (assert elapsed ≥ initial_backoff)
   * reconnect, re-Boot, resume heartbeats (assert heartbeat count increases post-reconnect)

2. **NoDoubleSend_AcrossReconnect**
   Client sends N tiny frames rapidly; server closes mid-stream. Assert:

   * all pendings at close resolve with `ConnectionClosed`
   * after reconnect and boot, **no previously sent frame is re-sent** automatically

3. **Backoff_ExpJitter**
   Force repeated immediate closes on accept to drive backoff. Capture the reconnect intervals and assert monotonic increase with jitter within your bounds.

4. **ResumeDelay_RespectsPolicy**
   After reconnect, assert the first heartbeat occurs **after** `resume_delay_ms` (± tolerance). This simulates libocpp’s `MessageQueueResumeDelay`. ([everest.github.io][3])

### Test scaffolding tweaks

* Teach your `TestServer` to: immediately close on first message, or close right after handshake, or close after X ms.
* Expose a hook that records timestamps of: connect, close, reconnect, boot accepted, first heartbeat.

## Part F — Stretch goals (nice-to-have, sets up later milestones)

* **Ping/Pong handling hook:** add a transport-level handler for server WebSocket `ping` that replies with `pong`. Even a stub today makes adding full support trivial later (you’ll see similar requests in libocpp). ([GitHub][2])
* **Reconnect triggers:** add a “manual drop” test path like `EnableExternalWebsocketControl` to programmatically force disconnects in tests. ([everest.github.io][3])
* **Metrics:** counters for reconnect attempts, last reconnect duration, last disconnect reason—this feeds Milestone 6.

If you want, I can draft a minimal C++ header sketch for the state machine and the four test skeletons next, but the outline above is enough to implement Milestone 3 without surprises and stays aligned with how libocpp treats online/offline transitions and queue resumption.

Got it—let’s turn Milestone 3 into a tight set of **build-it-yourself exercises** that walk you from zero → the reconnect controller API we sketched earlier, without handing over full code. Each exercise has: goal, files to touch, what to implement (signatures only), a test to write first (red → green), acceptance criteria, and hints. Do them in order.

---

# Exercise 0 — Test harness prep (10–20 min)

**Goal:** make it easy to simulate connects, closes, and timers deterministically.

**Touch:**

* `tests/` (new helpers: `fake_timers.hpp/.cpp` or inline test-local struct)
* `ws_server_session.hpp` (if you need a hook to force-close/close-after-accept)

**Implement (signatures only):**

```cpp
// tests/fake_timers.hpp
struct TimerPump {
  void post_after(std::chrono::milliseconds delay, std::function<void()> cb);
  void run_all();                 // run & clear everything
  template<class Pred> void run_while(Pred p); // optional
};
```

**Write this test first (should FAIL):**

* `TEST(Harness, TimersRun)`

  * `TimerPump t; int x=0; t.post_after(10ms,[&]{x=1;}); EXPECT_EQ(x,0); t.run_all(); EXPECT_EQ(x,1);`

**Acceptance:** you can schedule callbacks and run them on demand in tests.

**Hints:** keep it dead-simple; order doesn’t matter for now.

---

# Exercise 1 — Policy & Signals scaffolding (10 min)

**Goal:** define the knobs and callbacks (no behavior yet).

**Touch:** `include/ocppwo/reconnect.hpp`

**Implement (types only, no logic):**

```cpp
struct ReconnectPolicy {
  std::chrono::milliseconds initial_backoff{500};
  std::chrono::milliseconds max_backoff{30'000};
  float jitter_ratio{0.20f};
  std::chrono::milliseconds resume_delay{250};
};

enum class ConnState { Disconnected, Connecting, Connected, Closing };
enum class CloseReason { Clean, TransportError, ProtocolError };

struct ReconnectSignals {
  std::function<void()> on_connecting;
  std::function<void()> on_connected;
  std::function<void(CloseReason)> on_closed;
  std::function<void()> on_online;
  std::function<void()> on_offline;
  std::function<void(std::chrono::milliseconds)> on_backoff_scheduled;
};
```

**Test first:** `TEST(Reconnect, TypesCompile)`—include the header and just construct these structs.

**Acceptance:** builds link-free (header-only types).

---

# Exercise 2 — TransportOps DI (10–15 min)

**Goal:** define dependency injection points for connect/close/timers/clock.

**Touch:** `include/ocppwo/reconnect.hpp`

**Implement (signatures only):**

```cpp
struct TransportOps {
  std::function<void(const std::string& url, std::function<void(bool ok)>)> async_connect;
  std::function<void(std::function<void()>)> async_close;
  std::function<void(std::chrono::milliseconds, std::function<void()>)> post_after;
  std::function<std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point()> now;
};
```

**Test first:** `TEST(Reconnect, OpsAreAssignable)`—assign lambdas; no behavior.

**Acceptance:** compiles with your test lambdas.

---

# Exercise 3 — Controller shell & lifecycle API (20–30 min)

**Goal:** create the `ReconnectController` class with *state only*, no backoff or timers yet.

**Touch:** `include/ocppwo/reconnect.hpp`

**Implement (signatures + trivial state changes; no reconnection timers):**

```cpp
class ReconnectController {
public:
  ReconnectController(ReconnectPolicy, TransportOps, ReconnectSignals = {});
  void start(const std::string& url);      // sets state=Connecting, calls async_connect
  void stop();                              // sets state=Closing, calls async_close
  void on_transport_open();                 // sets state=Connected, resets attempt, emits on_connected
  void on_transport_close(CloseReason);     // sets state=Disconnected, emits on_closed/on_offline
  void on_boot_accepted();                  // schedule online after resume_delay (leave TODO)
  bool can_send() const;                    // Connected && online_
  ConnState state() const;
  bool online() const;
  int  attempt() const;
  std::chrono::milliseconds current_backoff() const; // return 0ms for now
};
```

**Test first (will FAIL until you wire simple state transitions):**

* `TEST(Reconnect, StartLeadsToConnecting)`
* `TEST(Reconnect, OpenLeadsToConnected)`
* `TEST(Reconnect, CloseLeadsToDisconnectedAndOffline)`

**Acceptance:** state transitions work; `can_send()` is false except after `on_boot_accepted()` (we’ll wire the delay later).

**Hints:** don’t implement backoff; just call `async_connect` immediately in `start`.

---

# Exercise 4 — Exponential backoff (no jitter) (25–35 min)

**Goal:** compute `backoff = min(max_backoff, initial_backoff * 2^(attempt-1))`.

**Touch:** `reconnect.hpp` (private method `compute_backoff_(int attempt)`)

**Implement:** pure function (no jitter yet).

**Test first:**

* `TEST(Backoff, ExponentialNoJitter)`

  * attempts 1..5 with `initial=100ms`, `max=1600ms` → expect `100,200,400,800,1600`.

**Acceptance:** passes exactly those values.

**Hints:** careful with integer overflow and attempt==0.

---

# Exercise 5 — Add jitter (±ratio) and record last_backoff (20–30 min)

**Goal:** apply jitter and store `last_backoff_`.

**Touch:** `reconnect.hpp`

**Implement:**

* `compute_backoff_` applies `*(1 ± jitter_ratio)`.
* store `last_backoff_` on each schedule.

**Test first (loose bounds):**

* `TEST(Backoff, JitterWithinBounds)`

  * run compute 20 times with `initial=1000ms`, `max=1000ms`, `ratio=0.2`
  * each result in `[800..1200]`.

**Acceptance:** bounds respected.

**Hints:** seeded RNG or deterministic generator okay; the test checks bounds, not exact values.

---

# Exercise 6 — Schedule reconnect on close (connect loop) (30–45 min)

**Goal:** on `on_transport_close`, schedule a timer with `last_backoff_` and then call `async_connect` again.

**Touch:** `reconnect.hpp` (implement `schedule_reconnect_()` and call it from close path)

**Test first:**

* `TEST(Reconnect, CloseSchedulesReconnect)`

  * inject `TimerPump.post_after` and capture scheduled delay
  * after `run_all()`, assert `async_connect` was invoked once.

**Acceptance:** exactly one reconnect attempt is scheduled per close; `attempt_` increments.

**Hints:** don’t allow reconnects when `state==Closing`.

---

# Exercise 7 — Resume delay gating for online/send (20–30 min)

**Goal:** `on_boot_accepted()` should flip `online_ = true` **after** `resume_delay`.

**Touch:** `reconnect.hpp`

**Test first:**

* `TEST(ResumeDelay, SendAllowedAfterDelay)`

  * call `on_transport_open()` → `on_boot_accepted()`
  * before `run_all()`: `can_send()==false`
  * after `run_all()`: `can_send()==true`.

**Acceptance:** passes.

**Hints:** use `post_after(resume_delay, ...)`.

---

# Exercise 8 — Integrate WsClient/Session events (45–60 min)

**Goal:** map your real transport to the controller.

**Touch:**

* `session.hpp/.cpp`
* `ws_client.hpp/.cpp`

**Implement (no full code, just wire points):**

* In `Session::Connect(url)`: `rc_.start(url)`; in `WsClient::on_open` → `rc_.on_transport_open()`.
* In `WsClient::on_close` → `rc_.on_transport_close(reason)`.
* After you send BootNotification and receive `Accepted` in `Session` → `rc_.on_boot_accepted()`.
* In your public `Session::Send(...)`: `if (!rc_.can_send()) return LocalError{ConnectionClosed};`

**Test first (integration-lite):**

* `TEST(Reconnect, BasicFlow)`

  * success connect → boot accepted → can_send
  * force-close from server → can_send becomes false
  * timer fires → reconnect → boot accepted → can_send true again.

**Acceptance:** all true with your real classes in test mode.

---

# Exercise 9 — No-double-send guarantee (45–60 min)

**Goal:** ensure all in-flight promises resolve with `ConnectionClosed` on close and **nothing auto-resends** after reconnect.

**Touch:** `session.cpp` (send queue + promise resolution)

**Implement (behavioral):**

* On close: cancel per-call timers; resolve promises with `ConnectionClosed`.
* On reconnect: **do not** re-enqueue anything from before close.

**Test first:**

* `TEST(Reconnect, NoDoubleSendAcrossReconnect)`

  * send N sequenced `Ping{seq=i}`
  * force close after k<N
  * assert server saw only the first k (no dupes)
  * after reconnect, send another batch with new seqs; assert strictly increasing, no repeats.

**Acceptance:** server log shows no duplicates across boundary.

**Hints:** keep a monotonically increasing `seq` and check set membership on server side.

---

# Exercise 10 — Backoff shape with failures (30–45 min)

**Goal:** prove exponential-ish growth with jitter and cap.

**Touch:** tests only.

**Test first:**

* `TEST(Reconnect, BackoffGrowthAndCap)`

  * make first 4 connects fail → capture scheduled delays → assert each is within jitter bounds and non-collapsing (e.g., `>= 0.6 * previous`) and never exceeds `max_backoff`.

**Acceptance:** passes with your RNG.

---

# Exercise 11 — Policy hook: resume delay (15–20 min)

**Goal:** confirm the knob works.

**Touch:** tests only.

**Test first:**

* `TEST(Reconnect, ResumeDelayPolicyRespected)`

  * set `resume_delay=750ms`
  * ensure `on_online` is called only after that delay (use `TimerPump` counters).

**Acceptance:** passes.

---

## You’re done when…

* All 8–11 tests pass red→green.
* `Session::Send()` fast-fails while offline/reconnecting.
* On reconnect, BootNotification is repeated, heartbeats resume only after `resume_delay`.
* No duplicates are observed across the reconnect boundary.
* Backoff grows with jitter and respects `max_backoff`.

---

## Optional stretch (nice to have later)

* Add a **manual drop** path (`Session::TestForceDrop()`) to help testing.
* Add **Ping/Pong** handler stub in `WsClient` (respond with Pong).
* Add metrics counters: reconnect attempts, last close reason, last reconnect duration.

---

If you want, tell me which file/class names you’d like the **exact function signatures** for (e.g., your `Session`, `WsClient`) and I’ll tailor the exercise stubs to your project’s API so you can paste them in without adjustments.
